# Taxonomy

**Spec version:** `1.0.0-draft` (see [Overview](index.md))

This document defines the **token taxonomy**: a hierarchical system of concept categories that classify design tokens, the **token term vocabulary** of allowed words within each category, and the **formatting style** rules that control serialization of structured token names into platform-consumable strings.

## Motivation

"Naming convention" is too broad a term when discussing malleability across platform teams. A token name like `accent-background-color-hover` embeds multiple independent decisions:

1. **Which concepts** are represented and in what hierarchy (taxonomy).
2. **Which words** describe each concept (vocabulary).
3. **How the words are rendered** — casing, delimiters, abbreviations, concept order (formatting).

Each layer has a different malleability profile: the taxonomy is shared across all platforms; the vocabulary is shared with platform-aware compromises; the formatting is platform-malleable.

## Three layers of naming

### Layer 1: Token taxonomy

A **token taxonomy** is a hierarchical set of concept categories for classifying design ideas and use cases. It creates a clear, consistent, and predictable shared language across disciplines and teams.

The taxonomy is **NORMATIVE** and **shared** — all platforms use the same concept categories in the same hierarchy. Changing the taxonomy changes the meaning of token names across the entire ecosystem.

Taxonomies are **scoped to specific token types** for clarity. The semantic/layout taxonomy defined in this document is one such scope; additional taxonomies (e.g. for color tokens) will be defined in future spec versions.

### Layer 2: Token term vocabulary

The **token term vocabulary** is the set of specific words used to describe each conceptual option within the taxonomy. The vocabulary creates a shared language across disciplines and teams.

The vocabulary is **NORMATIVE at the foundation level** — the foundation defines canonical terms. Platforms **MAY** declare vocabulary mappings (e.g. `hover` → `highlighted` for iOS) in their [manifest](manifest.md) for platform-specific consumption.

### Layer 3: Formatting style

**Formatting style** defines rules for altering the appearance of a token's name for platform-specific consumption and usability needs. This includes concept ordering, casing, delimiters, and abbreviations.

Formatting is **platform-malleable** — each platform manifest **MAY** declare its own formatting rules. The foundation defines a default formatting style for legacy compatibility.

**NORMATIVE:** The name object defined in [Token format](token-format.md) is unordered structured data. Concept ordering is purely a serialization concern and **MUST NOT** affect cascade resolution, specificity, or validation.

## Principles

The taxonomy is designed with three guiding principles:

1. **Object-oriented** — Designers and developers think in terms of how they would construct components, rather than abstract semantic ideas.
2. **Agnostic (with compromises)** — Platform-agnostic terms are used except when platforms have specific terms for the same concept. In those cases, the most common or clear term is used.
3. **Verified** — Multiple existing components must be rebuildable using the taxonomy system, and consumers must find them reasonably understandable or learnable.

## Semantic / layout token taxonomy

Concept categories for name-object fields are declared in the design system's **field catalog** — a set of field declarations in the `fields/` directory, each conforming to [`field.schema.json`](../schemas/field.schema.json). Each declaration specifies the field name, vocabulary registry, validation severity, and default serialization position.

**NORMATIVE:** The field catalog is the authoritative source for what fields exist on the name object. Tools, validators, and serializers **SHOULD** read the catalog rather than hardcoding field knowledge.

The following concept categories are defined in Spectrum's foundation field catalog for semantic and layout tokens, ordered by default serialization position. This ordering is the **default serialization order** for legacy format output; it is not a conformance requirement for stored name objects.

**NORMATIVE:** Each category listed below corresponds to a field on the token [name object](token-format.md). Tokens **MAY** use any subset of these fields. Exception: `property` is REQUIRED on every name object — see [token-format.md](token-format.md#name-object).

| Category      | Name object field | Answers   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Structure     | `structure`       | What?     | Individual objects or object categories that have shared styling. Distinctly different from "components" in that they represent structures and visual patterns that can or do occur across many varieties of components.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Sub-structure | `substructure`    | What?     | A structure within an element that should only exist within the context of its parent structure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Component     | `component`       | What?     | Component scope when the token is component-scoped.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Anatomy       | `anatomy`         | What?     | A visible, named part of a component as defined by designers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Object        | `object`          | Where?    | The styling surface to which a visual property is applied (e.g. background, border, edge).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Property      | `property`        | Where?    | The CSS/styling attribute or design-system abstraction being defined (e.g. color, width, padding, gap). REQUIRED — see exception in preamble. Values SHOULD come from [`property-terms.json`](../../packages/design-system-registry/registry/property-terms.json). Anatomy parts and styling surfaces do NOT belong here — they belong in `anatomy` and `object` respectively. See [token-format.md — Name-object migration policy](token-format.md#name-object-migration-policy) for migration guidance. |
| Orientation   | `orientation`     | When/Why? | The direction or order of structures and elements within a component or pattern.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Position      | `position`        | When/Why? | The location of an object relative to another, with or without respect to directional order.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Size          | `size`            | When/Why? | Relative terms used to create relationships and patterns of usage across multiple tokens and token types.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Density       | `density`         | When/Why? | Options that create more or less space within or around the parts of a component.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Shape         | `shape`           | When/Why? | Relative to the overall shape of a component (e.g. "uniform" creates a 1:1 padding ratio between horizontal and vertical padding).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Additional categories for variant and state are inherited from the existing name object:

| Category | Name object field | Description                                                  |
| -------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Variant  | `variant`         | Variant within a component (e.g. accent, negative, primary). |
| State    | `state`           | Interactive or semantic state (e.g. hover, focus, disabled). |

**NOTE:** The categories above are filtered for semantic and layout token taxonomies. Additional taxonomies for other token types (color, typography, motion) will be defined in future spec versions — see the open follow-up RFC discussion [#806](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-design-data/discussions/806) (Q3, taxonomy scoping). The taxonomy is built to scale as new concepts and terms are identified.

### Structure vs. component — when does the line move?

The `structure` and `component` fields both answer "What?" but apply at different scopes. A useful rule of thumb:

* Use `component` when the token belongs to a specific component's surface (e.g. `button-background-color` — the background color of the Button component).
* Use `structure` when the token belongs to a reusable visual pattern that recurs **across** components (e.g. `container-padding` — padding for any container-shaped surface, regardless of which component owns it).

**Worked example — `card`:**

* As a `structure`: when "card" describes a layout primitive used inside many components (e.g. `card-padding-medium` on a list item, a popover body, or a modal header), the token is structure-scoped.
* As a `component`: when "card" describes the dedicated Card component's own surfaces (e.g. `card-background-color` on the Card root), the token is component-scoped.

The same word can validly appear in both fields across the dataset; they are independent. Authors choose based on whether the token's *meaning* generalizes across many components (structure) or is specific to one component's identity (component).

## Component anatomy vs. token objects

Two concepts that are often conflated but serve different purposes:

### Component anatomy

**Component anatomy** refers to the visible, named parts of a component as defined by designers. These are the parts called out in component specification diagrams (e.g. icon, label, track, handle, hold icon).

Component anatomy is declared per component in [component schemas](../../component-schemas/) and validated against the anatomy registry. A token referencing a component's anatomy part (e.g. `slider` + `handle`) can be validated as a legitimate combination.

Anatomy parts fall into three tiers:

| Tier               | Description                            | Examples                                                      |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Primitive          | Reusable across many components        | icon, label, track, handle, fill, divider, title, description |
| Composite          | Another component used as a named part | checkbox, close button, popover, avatar                       |
| Component-specific | Unique to one component                | loupe, gripper, opacity checkerboard                          |

### Token objects (styling surfaces)

**Token objects** (or styling surfaces) describe *where* a visual property is applied on a UI element. These are NOT anatomy — they are abstract styling targets that exist on any element regardless of its component type.

| Object       | Description                                           |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `background` | Background surface or fill                            |
| `border`     | Border or outline                                     |
| `edge`       | Outer boundary of component (used in spacing tokens)  |
| `visual`     | Visible graphic element area (may be inset from edge) |
| `content`    | Main content area                                     |

Token objects are stored in a separate registry from anatomy parts. Both may appear in the same token name — e.g. a token for the background color of a slider's handle would reference anatomy `handle` and object `background`.

## Name object field categories

Name object fields fall into two categories with different validation behavior:

### Semantic fields

Semantic fields describe identity, structure, and intent. They are used for querying and organization but do **not** participate in cascade resolution or specificity calculation.

**NORMATIVE:** Semantic field values are validated against their declared vocabulary registry with the severity specified in the field declaration (typically **advisory** — warning, not error). Values not in the registry are permitted but flagged.

Semantic fields are those declared with `kind: "semantic"` in the field catalog. In Spectrum's foundation catalog, these are: `structure`, `substructure`, `component`, `anatomy`, `object`, `property`, `variant`, `state`, `orientation`, `position`, `size`, `density`, `shape`.

### Mode-set fields

Mode-set fields represent axes of variation that drive the [cascade](cascade.md) resolution algorithm and [specificity](cascade.md#semantic-specificity) calculation.

**NORMATIVE:** Mode-set field values are validated against declared [mode set](mode-sets.md) modes with **strict** severity (error). An invalid mode value would silently fail to match any context during cascade resolution.

Mode-set fields are those declared with `kind: "mode-set"` in the field catalog, plus any additional mode set keys from the dataset's [mode set declarations](mode-sets.md). In Spectrum's foundation catalog, the standard mode-set fields are: `colorScheme`, `scale`, `contrast`.

See [Mode Sets](mode-sets.md) for mode set declarations, modes, and defaults.

## Default serialization (legacy format)

The **default serialization** produces a kebab-case string from the name object by ordering fields according to their `serialization.position` values (ascending) as declared in the field catalog. Omitted fields are skipped.

For Spectrum's foundation catalog, this produces the following concept order:

```
{variant}-{component}-{structure}-{substructure}-{anatomy}-{object}-{property}-{orientation}-{position}-{size}-{density}-{shape}-{state}
```

All fields are independent — `variant` and `component` **MAY** both appear in the same token name (e.g. a token with `component: "button"` and `variant: "accent"` serializes as `accent-button-...`).

This ordering is preserved for backward compatibility with the current `@adobe/spectrum-tokens` package. It is a serialization convention, not a structural requirement.

**NORMATIVE:** A conforming formatter **MUST** produce deterministic output for a given name object and formatting configuration. Two name objects that differ only in field ordering **MUST** produce identical serialized strings.

## Platform formatting configuration

A platform [manifest](manifest.md) **MAY** declare formatting rules in its [`extensions.formatting`](manifest.md#extensionsformatting) section to control concept ordering, casing, delimiters, and abbreviations. The normative contract for these fields is defined in [Manifest — `extensions.formatting`](manifest.md#extensionsformatting).

When no platform formatting is declared, the default serialization above is used.

## Scalability

The taxonomy and terms are built to scale as new concepts and terms are identified:

* New concept categories **MAY** be added by creating a new field declaration file in the field catalog — no spec version change is required for the mechanism itself.
* New terms **MAY** be added to the vocabulary registry without spec version changes.
* New token type taxonomies (beyond semantic/layout) **MAY** be defined in future spec versions.
